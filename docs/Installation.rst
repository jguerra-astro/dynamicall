``DynamicAll`` is currently not available on PyPI, but it can be installed by cloning the GitHub repository e.g::

    $ cd dynamicAll

    $ cd Agama
    
    $ pip install .


We suggest you look at the `installation instructions for Jax <https://github.com/google/jax#installation>`_ to minimize errors.
Specially since installation instructions will vary depending on whether you have a gpu or not.
We suggest that you run this on a GPU for speed reasons.
