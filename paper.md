# Summary



# Statement of need

In recent years the use of GPU accelerated codes as well as the use of automatic differentiation and hamiltonian monte carlo has become increasily widely adopted in the field of astronomy.
As data sets become larger and more complex, the need for efficient and scalable tools to model the dynamics of galaxies has become more pressing.
We present a new tool, `Dynamicall`, which is built on top of the `Jax` and `Numpyro` libraries, and is designed to be a flexible and efficient tool for modeling the dynamics of galaxies.
